It follows three main guidelines:\n\n1. Performance is mandatory, not a nice-to-have.\n2. Components should be as customizable as possible.\n3. Components should be as accessible as possible (falling back to WAI-ARIA attributes when necessary.)\n\nThe general idea of this library is to provide ready-to-go solutions for things you really wouldn't want to build yourself, not because they're hard... but because they're hard to design _right_. We are always open to suggestions and strive to keep Boundless as concise and useful as possible.\n\n## Reference styles\n\nA precompiled base \"skin\" is available to use as a base when customizing Boundless for your own project. Some of the components do rely on the reference layout in their styles to function properly. It is designed to be very unopinionated.\n\nYou can find the compiled CSS at `/public/skin.css`. There is a minified version available as well: `/public/skin.min.css`.\n\nThe Boundless website is based on this skin with branding colors, etc.\n\n## Branding Boundless\n\nThanks to the modular nature of [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/), injecting your own customization to things like accent color(s) is extremely simple.\n\nIn your own project's `.styl` file, define any variable overrides (see [variables.styl](https://github.com/enigma-io/boundless/blob/master/variables.styl) for what variables can be overridden), then import Boundless's master styl file:\n\n```stylus\n// first, pull in the variables\n@require \"node_modules/boundless/variables\";\n\n// do overrides as desired...\ncolor-accent = red;\n\n// then pull in the rest of the styles\n@require \"node_modules/boundless/style\";\n```\n\nNext time your project's CSS is built, Boundless's CSS will automatically be compiled with the appropriate changes and included in your stylesheet.\n\n## Developing Boundless\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:enigma-io/boundless.git boundless\ncd boundless\n\nnpm i\nnpm start # runs the development server so you can make changes live ✨\n```\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/enigma-io/boundless/blob/master/LICENSE)"}});
